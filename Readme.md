# <img src=".\Graphics\icon.ico" width="23" height="" title="R6S Roulette Logo"> R6S OPS Roulette 
A simple Roulette for Rainbow Six Siege to give random operator every round or match to have fun while playing and most importantly to throw em matches :D.
<br><br>

# How to use
* if you just want to download its easy go to [release](https://github.com/itsW3RN3R/R6S-Operators-Roulette/releases "Releases") and download Release.Zip launch the `R6OPS Roulette.exe` and enjoy.<br>
* But if you want to edit the code or add something (am pretty sure you know how to download/clone since you want source code :D) just make sure to put folder called `icons` inside `Debug or Release` Folder i couldn't figure out a way around it tired of googling for it i give up for now atleast am noobie sry.<br>
<br><br>


# Preview

* Now the Mode is set to hardcore that means list contains only hard OPS to play or so they say. <br>
